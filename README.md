# xmrig-service

Because I'd like to have it run on boot

All this little thingie do is run `xmrig --config=/etc/xmrig.json` on system boot, rest is up to you.

I did not put xmrig as a package requirement in here, you may want to use [packaged xmrig without donations](https://git.mrcyjanek.net/MrCyjaneK/xmrig-pack)
